### Submission Guidelines for Assignments
First, fork the repository and clone it in your local machine. Create a folder of the format rollno_name with your roll no and name (for eg, 210944_SaumyaGupta in my case). Create folder Assignment1 inside the previous folder and upload your solution files there. Commit your changes and generate a pull request. Follow the same for all assignments.

Note: Follow the submission guidelines strictly.
